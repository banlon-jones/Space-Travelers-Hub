# Space-Travelers-Hub
The Space Travelers' Hub consists of Rockets, Missions, and the My Profile section. The Rockets section displays a list of all available SpaceX rockets. Users can book each rocket by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking. The Missions section displays a list of current missions along with their brief description and participation status, a button that allows users to join the selected mission or leave the mission the user joined earlier. The Dragons section displays a list of all available SpaceX dragons. Users can book each dragon by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking. The My Profile section displays all reserved rockets and space missions.

This project is part of the Microverse curriculum block 4 module 3. The main objective is to understand how create a React app, use components, hooks, state, redux, run tests, and creating professional documentation for development.
